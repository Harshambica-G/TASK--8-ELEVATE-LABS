# 🧠 K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset

This project demonstrates **unsupervised learning** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** on the popular **Mall Customers dataset**. The aim is to segment customers into groups based on their behavior and demographics.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about mall customers including:

* **CustomerID**
* **Gender**
* **Age**
* **Annual Income (k\$)**
* **Spending Score (1–100)**

## 📌 Objectives

* Perform **data preprocessing** and visualization
* Apply **PCA** to reduce dimensions for 2D plotting
* Use **K-Means clustering** to group customers
* Determine the **optimal number of clusters** using the **Elbow Method**
* Evaluate clusters using the **Silhouette Score**
* Visualize clusters with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 📊 Results

* Applied **PCA** for 2D visualization
* Used **Elbow Method** to find the optimal `K` (e.g., 5)
* Evaluated clustering using **Silhouette Score**
* Visualized customer segments in a 2D plot
